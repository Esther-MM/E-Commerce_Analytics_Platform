Phase 4: Stored Procedures & Functions
Automated Decision Making - Stored procedures for dynamic pricing and inventory management

This phase focuses on embedding business logic directly into the database using MySQL stored procedures and a user-defined function. 
These SQL components automate complex analytics tasks that would otherwise require manual scripting

‚úÖ Function
CalculateOrderProfit(order_id)
Use case: Enables quick profitability analysis for finance and operations teams.

‚úÖ Procedures
1. GetLowStockAlerts(threshold_quantity)
Generates a stock status report for all products below a specified inventory threshold. It also considers units sold in the last 30 days and classifies stock levels as:
Use case: Supports inventory planning and restocking decisions.

2. CalculateCustomerSegmentation()
Segments customers using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) logic. The procedure classifies users into actionable groups like:
Use case: Powers personalized marketing, re-engagement campaigns, and lifetime value tracking.

Business Value:
